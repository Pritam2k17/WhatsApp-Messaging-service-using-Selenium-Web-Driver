# WhatsApp-Messaging-service-using-Selenium-Web-Driver
I wrote a code that can text someone in WhatsApp using Selenium Web Driver. The only error I come across is my code can't open the browser on it's own. I have to keep my browser open say it be Chrome and then it automatically opens the WhatsApp Web to send the text message to the number I want.
